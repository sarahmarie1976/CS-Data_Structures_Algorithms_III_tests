What are the primary weaknesses of a hash table?

A. if you have the key, you can quickly retrieve the value. However, if you have the value and need to get the keys, that is a slow O(n) operation

B. They are not that flexible because you can only use integers as keys

C. In the worst case, all operations have an O(n) time complexity

D. The keys are not stored in any order

E. None of the above




Answer is:

 if you have the key, you can quickly retrieve the value. However, if you have the value and need to get the keys, that is a slow O(n) operation

 The keys are not stored in any order
