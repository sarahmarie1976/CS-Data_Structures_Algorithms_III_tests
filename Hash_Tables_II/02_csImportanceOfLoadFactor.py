Why is the load factor of a hash table important?

A. As the load factor of your hash table increases, so does the likeilhodd of a collision, which reduces your hash table's performance. When the load factore gets too large, you need to use a different data structure to store your data.

B. As the load factor to your hash table increases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which reduced your hash table's performance. It is important to monitor the load factor and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too large.

C. The load factor of a hash table is not important as long as you use a linked list to build your hash table. 

D. As the load factor of your hash table decreases, so does the likelihodd of a collision, which causes your hash table's performance to get worse. It is important to monitor the load factor and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too small.


Answer is:

As the load factor to your hash table increases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which reduced your hash table's performance. It is important to monitor the load factor and resize your hash table when the load factor gets too large.
